        "The CPU is often referred to as the \"brain\" of a computer because it performs the following key functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Arithmetic and Logical Operations (ALU)\n",
        " - Executes mathematical operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).\n",
        " - Performs logical comparisons (e.g., greater than, less than, equal to).  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. Control Unit Operations(CU):\n",
        " - Decodes/follow instructions and sends signals to execute them.\n",
        "3. Memory unit (MU): Memory Units (MU) are components used to store data temporarily or permanently.\n",

        "### Key Features of a GPU:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Parallel Processing Power:\n",
        "  - GPUs are designed with thousands of smaller, efficient cores that can perform calculations simultaneously.\n",
        "  - This makes them ideal for tasks that require processing large amounts of data in parallel, such as rendering images, video processing, and scientific computations.\n",
        "2. Specialization in Graphics:\n",
        "  - GPUs are optimized for rendering 2D and 3D graphics, enabling smooth visual performance in video games, animations, and graphical user interfaces.\n",

        "1. **CUDA Cores or Stream Processors**:\n",
        "  - Execute parallel operations on large data sets.\n",
        "  - In NVIDIA GPUs, they are called CUDA Cores, while AMD refers to them as Stream Processors.\n",

        "2. **Memory (VRAM):** High-speed memory for storing images and textures.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Tensor Cores:**\n",
        " - Specialized cores found in modern GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA) designed for AI and machine learning tasks.\n",
        " - Perform tensor operations efficiently, which are critical for training and inference in neural networks.\n",
