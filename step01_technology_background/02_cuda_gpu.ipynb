        "CUDA stands for Compute Unified Device Architecture, and it's a parallel computing platform and programming model created by Nvidia.\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows developers to write software that can harness the power of Nvidia GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) to perform general-purpose computing tasks, not just graphics rendering, meaning that Developers can create the softwere using any programing language like python or C++ and then can run that software in the CUDA GPU for faster processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gaming industries got boom due to the CUDA GPU's invention in 2006.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### In Practical Terms:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **You Write Code:** You write the program in a coding language like C++ or Python.\n",
        "2. **Use CUDA:** You use CUDA libraries to enable the code to run on the Nvidia GPU. The GPU can then do many calculations at once, which is much faster than a traditional CPU.\n",
        "3. **VS Code:** You use VS Code as your editor to write this code. Once written, you can compile or run the software directly from there (or using terminal/command line tools).\n",
        "\n",
        "So in essence, it means you can create software (code) using a programming language, and by using CUDA, you can make the program run on a GPU for faster processing."
