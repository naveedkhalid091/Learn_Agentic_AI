        "\n",
        "2. Gemini can now adjusts its interaction style based on your IQ (intelligence quotient) and EQ (emotional intelligence). Conversations feel natural and are tailored to your intellectual and emotional context\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Gemini can control your device activities, through calling APIs. Tasks such as sending E-mails automatically, Liking or disliking the social media posts, Tracking activitites and many more can be automated.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Purpose of the making the `client` object:\n",
        " - The client acts as a bridge between your application and the Google Generative AI APIs.\n",
        " - Using this `client`, you can send requests (e.g., text generation, image generation) and receive responses from the GenAI service.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why create a Client instance?:\n",
        "\n",
        "- To access the API, you need a way to manage settings like authentication (e.g., your API key) and connection details.\n",
        "- The Client class encapsulates all these details, so you don't have to manually configure them for each API call.\n",
        "\n",
        "**In simpler terms:**\n",
        " - Think of the client as your personal assistant for talking to the Generative AI service.\n",
        " - Instead of handling the API's complex details yourself, you tell the client what you want, and it takes care of the rest.  \n"
