        " - **\"google-generativeai>=0.7.2\" (First code)** :  This is the foundational SDK that provides direct access to Google's Generative AI APIs. It offers more granular control and access to the full range of features provided by the API, making it suitable for production environments where stability and comprehensive feature access are crucial.\n",

It simplifies many operations, making it suitable for rapid prototyping (which involves creating an early, simplified version of the software, you can test and validate your software at early stages) and development. However, as of December 2024, it's in early development, and its API is subject to change.
