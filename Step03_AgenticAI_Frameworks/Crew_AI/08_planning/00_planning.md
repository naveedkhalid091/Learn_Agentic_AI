## Planning:

Planning feature in crewAI helps you to understand how to add the planning part into your crew and imporve the performance of your crew.

The planning feature in CrewAI allows you to add planning capability to your crew. When enabled, before each Crew iteration, all Crew information is sent to an AgentPlanner that will plan the tasks step by step, and this plan will be added to each task description.

### Using the Planning Feature:

Getting started with the planning feature is very easy, the only step required is to add **planning=True** to your Crew:

```python
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process

# Assemble your crew with planning capabilities
my_crew = Crew(
    agents=self.agents,
    tasks=self.tasks,
    process=Process.sequential,
    planning=True,
)
```

From this point on, your crew will have planning enabled, and the tasks will be planned before each iteration.

### Planning LLM:

Now you can define the LLM that will be used to plan the tasks.

When running the base case example, you will see something like the output below, which represents the output of the AgentPlanner responsible for creating the step-by-step logic to add to the Agentsâ€™ tasks.

```python
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process
# Assemble your crew with planning capabilities and custom LLM
my_crew = Crew(
    agents=self.agents,
    tasks=self.tasks,
    process=Process.sequential,
    planning=True,
    planning_llm="gpt-4o"
)

# Run the crew
my_crew.kickoff()
```

### Coding comparison with and without planning mode:

Below is the link of Panaversity repository where the comparison is shown by executing the code with and without planning:
