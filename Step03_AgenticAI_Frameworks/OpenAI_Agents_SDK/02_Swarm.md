## Swarm:

Introducing **Swarm** was the first OpenAI's attempt to create agents. Swarm was the experimental framework. It had introduced the two primary abstractions:

1. Agents: which encompass specific instructions and tools
2. Handsoff: enabling agents to transfer control to one another.

This design allows for scalable and testable coordination among multiple AI agents, each specializing in distinct tasks, to collaboratively achieve complex objectives.

OpenAI has now released the Agents SDK, a new framework after experiments from the Swarm framework, the Agents SDK builds upon the foundational concepts introduced in Swarm, offering enhanced features for orchestrating the workflow of multiple AI agents.

This advancement enables developers to manage and coordinate complex tasks more effectively, ensuring that various agents work harmoniously towards unified goals.

Therefore, the recently released **OpenAI Agents SDK is indeed based on the design patterns and principles initially explored in the Swarm framework**, marking a significant step towards more sophisticated and integrated multi-agent AI systems.

### Anthropic Design Patterns:

This SDK aligns closely with several design patterns proposed by Anthropic for building effective agents, allowing developers to implement these patterns seamlessly.

1. Prompt Chaining (Chain Workflow):
   This pattern involves breaking down complex tasks into a sequence of simpler, manageable steps, where each step builds upon the previous one.
   **Example:**
   Think of writing a research paper:

   - Step 1: Gather background information.
   - Step 2: Create an outline.
   - Step 3: Write a draft based on the outline.
   - Step 4: Revise and refine the draft.

   Each step helps ensure that the final product is detailed and accurate.

2. Routing:
   Based on the task's (prompt) nature, the tasks are directed to the most appropriate agent through the routing mechanism. The Agents SDK facilitates this through its handoff mechanism, enabling agents to transfer control to other agents better suited to handle specific subtasks.

3. Parallelization:
   This pattern focuses on executing multiple subtasks concurrently to enhance efficiency. With the Agents SDK, developers can design agents that operate in parallel, leveraging the SDK's orchestration capabilities to manage simultaneous processes effectively.

4. Orchestrator-Workers:
   In this design, an orchestrator agent decomposes a complex task into smaller subtasks and assigns them to worker agents. The Agents SDK's architecture supports this by allowing an orchestrator agent to oversee the workflow and delegate tasks to specialized worker agents, ensuring coordinated task execution (Routing+ Paralleization).

5. Evaluator-Optimizer:
   This pattern involves iterative improvement through feedback loops, where an evaluator agent assesses the performance of other agents and suggests optimizations. The Agents SDK's guardrails feature enables the implementation of such evaluative mechanisms, allowing for continuous performance enhancement and adherence to desired behaviors.
