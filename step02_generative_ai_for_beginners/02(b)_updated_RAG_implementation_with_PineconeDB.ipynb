            "Matter exists in three physical states i.e. gas, liquid and solid. The simplest form\n",
            "of matter is the gaseous state. Liquids are less common and most of the matter exists as\n",
            "solid. Matter in gaseous state does not have definite shape and volume. Therefore, gases\n",
            "occupy all the available space. Their intermolecular forces are very weak. Pressure is a\n",
            "significant property of gases. The effect of pressure and temperature on volume of a gas\n",
            "has been studied quite extensively.\n",
            "The liquid state has strong intermolecular forces hence it has definite volume but\n",
            "it does not have definite shape. It attains the shape of the container in which it is kept.\n",
            "Liquids evaporate and their vapours exert pressure. When vapour pressure of a liquid\n",
            "becomes equal to external pressure, it boils. Liquids are less mobile than gases therefore,\n",
            "they diffuse slowly.\n",
            "The solid state has definite volume and shape. They are rigid and denser than\n",
            "liquids and gases. They exist in amorphous or crystalline forms.\n",
