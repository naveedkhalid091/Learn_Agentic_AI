### 1. What are the Design Patterns?

A design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a common problem that arises within a specific context.

As far as building the AI agents, Anthropic company has given their design patterns, by following these design patterns we can build agents easily.

### Anthropic Design Patterns:

According to the Anthrpoic Design Patterns agents can be built in two ways or there are two types of agents.

1. **Workflow Based Agents:** These types of agents will be built based on pre-defined steps, these types of agents will follow the step by step guidelines to complete a given task.
   e.g if user ask these types of agents to write the blog/thesis then developers will instruct them to follow a certain pattern i.e. step#1 agent will have to search content from the internet, step#2 verify the content, Step#3: Write thesis and at step# 4: Check for plagiarism and finally give the output to users with plagiarism score.
2. **Autonomous Agents:** These type of agents will not follow instructions or steps rather they will work autonomously to complete the certain tasks.
