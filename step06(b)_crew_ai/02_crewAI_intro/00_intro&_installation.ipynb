    "  - **Open source**: The tool's code is freely available for anyone to use, modify, or improve.\n",
    "  - **Production-grade framework:** It’s built to be robust and reliable enough for real-world applications.\n",
    "  -  It helps manage a group of independent AI programs, each given a specific role or job, so they can work together like a real team (or “crew”) to get complex tasks done.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means CrewAI lets you set up and run a team of specialized AI helpers that collaborate automatically to solve problems efficiently.\n",

    "## **Installation of CrewAI:** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequsites:** \n",
    "   - i) Python installation: CrewAI requires Python versions 3.10 to less than 3.13, If your version is outside this range, update or install the appropriate version from python.org/downloads.\n",
    "   - ii) Package Manager (pip): Ensure that you have pip installed. This is the default package installer for Python and usually comes bundled with Python installations. pip is used to install CrewAI and its additional tools.\n",
    "   - iii) Virtual Environment : It is advised to set up a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies.\n",
    "       - **Options:** Conda, poetry or uv (We will use UV package manager) in crewai. \n",
    "       Setting up a virtual environment prevents conflicts with other projects and makes dependency management much easier.\n",
    "   - iv) Additional Microsoft Build Tools: \n",
    "       - **Rust Compiler:** Some dependencies (e.g., for the tiktoken module) might require a Rust compiler if a pre-built wheel isn’t available. \n",
    "        \n",
    "         - Download [RUST](https://rustup.rs/). \n",
    "         - You can check Rust complier after downloading through command `rustc --version`\n",
    "\n",
    "       - **Windows Specific:** Windows users may also need to have the **Visual C++ Build Tools** installed if issues arise during wheel building. \n",
    "       \n",
    "         - You can download it from [MS Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have fullfilled above **requirements** then you can install crewAI using below code: \n",
    "\n",
    " `pip install crewai crewai-tools`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " If you have an older version of CrewAI installed, you can upgrade it:\n",
